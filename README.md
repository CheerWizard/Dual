# Features
Captures images into different surfaces from different camera lenses at the same time in parallel.
# Limitations
Able to capture from different lenses directions in parallel at one time. For example : Front + Back + External will be captured into different surfaces.

NOT able to capture from lenses that are facing into one direction at one time. For example : Front 1 + Front 2 won't be captured into different surfaces.

NOT able to open more than 2 or 3 camera lenses at one time in parallel. For example you will be able to capture from Front + Back cameras at one time. 
But you might not me able capture from Front + Back + External cameras at one time (it depends on your camera hardware).
